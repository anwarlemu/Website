        Switching Off Autopilot Mode	
    </b>
    <br><br>
    - As many as 40% of our actions are habits. They don’t require conscious thought or heavy deliberation. <br><br>
    - While doing a task, it’s worth periodically asking: "What percentage of my attention am I devoting to this task?" <br>
    - <i>I marked 75% – I was working hard to pay attention, but my mind kept drifting to various other things.</i><br><br>
    - Research shows the eyes register information more slowly when the mind is wandering – e.g. the mind and eyes are “tightly coupled.”<br><br>
    - Four types of tasks <br><br>
    - Quadrant formed by two axis <br>
    - Unattractive/attractive work <br>
    - Productive/unproductive work <br><br>
    - Necessary Work <br>
    - Productive/Unattractive <br>
    - Things you have to do. Team meetings, budget balancing <br><br>
    - Purposeful Work <br>
    - Productive/Attractive <br>
    - The tasks that are challenging, that provide a lot of satisfaction to you and value to the world. <br><br>
    - Unnecessary Work <br>
    - Unattractive/Unproductive <br>
    - Rearranging papers on your desk. Things you don’t do unless your brain is resisting a more challenging task. <br>
    - <i>“Procrastiworking”</i><br><br>
    - Distracting Work <br>
    - Attractive/Unproductive <br>
    - Stimulating, yet unproductive “tasks” – social media, checking email and Slack, etc. <br><br>
    - Each day, all four types of tasks compete for our attention. The more we’re on autopilot, the more time we’ll spend in the wrong type. <br><br>
    - <i>Takeaway: Be more intentional about where you place your focus. Take more breaks to recharge this ability for when needed throughout the day. 
    (This is why Pomodoro works.)</i>

        The Limits of Your Attention	
    </b>
    <br><br>
- “There’s a finite limit to how many things we can focus on.” <br><br>
- The brain receives 11 million “bits” of info every second, according to Timothy Wilson. <br><br>
- The mind can only consciously process 40 of those. <br>
- Csikszentmihalyi: The simple act of decoding a conversation (parsing the language so we understand it) consumes about half our attentional resources. <br>
- Working memory: After focusing on something, we can only hold so much of it in working memory. The average is **four bits**. <br>
    - Some people can naturally hold more – often up to 7 without other aids <br>
    - <b>Chunking</b> can aide working memory by bundling bits together through meaning – e.g. names in a list could be bundled 
    if some of them are your friends or people you talk to often, or if some start with the same letter. <br><br>
- Popular culture has tons of examples of groups of information ranging from 2-7 bits. <br>
    - Pairs – Calvin and Hobbes <br>
    - Three – Third time’s the charm <br>
    - Seven – 7 Wonders of the world <br><br>
- It’s harder to find lots of examples that involve more discrete bits <br><br>
- Attentional space and working memory are like a computer’s RAM. <br><br>
- RAM capacity scales with power usage – with more active RAM, a computer uses more power. <br>
    - This is why Apple resisted upping the RAM capacity of the iPhone – lower battery time would result. <br><br>
- Some scientists say that additional working memory or attentional space in the brain would be more “biologically expensive”. <br><br>
- The brain already consumes 20% of calories ingested, even though it accounts for only 2-3% of body mass. <br><br>
- Sentence structure matters for attention and comprehension. One study found that the period at the end of a 
sentence marks the point at which the brain stops loading things into attentional space and summarizes what has been 
loaded to that point so that it fits better into working memory and can be synthesized. <br><br>
- <b>Meta-awareness</b>: Becoming aware of what you are thinking about. <br>
    - A useful skill for managing your attention and thoughts. <br>
    - Better you get at this, the better you become at bringing your attention back to your intended area of focus when it wanders. <br><br>
- Noticing what is in the attentional space makes you a better thinker and problem-solver. <br>
    - A study found that people asked to solve a mystery while reading a detective novel – those whose minds wandered consciously 
    solved it more successfully than those who did not pay attention to where their minds wandered. <br><br>
- <b>Mindfulness:</b> Not judging what you’re thinking about. <br><br>
- A memory of the attentional space lasts on average 10 seconds. Very ephemeral. <br><br>
- Tasks that pair well <br>
    - Some tasks do not fill the entire attentional space. Typically, these are habitual tasks. <br><br>
- Habits only require attention when **initiated**, or when you need to make a course correction during one. <br><br>
- We can multitask well if the tasks are habit-based, or if only one task is mildly complex. <br><br>
- Multitasking with habit-based tasks is helped by the brain – it directs blood toward the basal ganglia (which is concerned with habits) and 
away from the prefrontal cortex (the logic center). <br><br>
- Assess: If you can do your most productive tasks out of habit, then you’re probably not challenging yourself enough.  
It’s time to delegate those tasks to someone else or automate them. <br><br>
- Multi-tasking does not work when the tasks being juggle exceed the capacity of attentional space. Two complex tasks will do this. <br><br>
- 3 combinations of tasks that can fit within attentional space <br><br>
- A few small, habit-based tasks <br>
    - Initiating the habit requires attention, but after that, it’s on autopilot. <br>
    - One task that requires *most* of our focus, along with a habit-based task <br>
    - One complex task <br><br>
- Good to leave a bit of attentional space to spare when doing a complex task. It: <br>
    - Leaves room to reflect on the best way to finish the task <br>
    - Greater awareness of where you should be directing your attention. Increased ability to redirect attention when it wanders. <br>
- <b>Intention</b>: “Intention enables us to prioritize so we don’t overload our attentional space.” <br><br>
- Noticing that you’re feeling overwhelmed is a good cue for checking in on what’s occupying your attentional space. <br><br>
- Brain’s novelty bias – when you switch tasks, you’re rewarded with a dopamine hit. Managing your time and motivation <br>
    - “Continually seeking novel stimuli makes us *feel* more productive – after all, we’re doing more at the moment. But again, 
    just because we’re busier doesn’t mean we’re getting more accomplished.” <br>
    - Early ancestors were well-served by this because it allowed them to keep constant tabs on a changing, dangerous environment. <br>
    - <b>Productivity:</b> Chris’ definition of productivity: Productivity means accomplishing what we intend to. <br>
    - <b>Bailey:</b> “Productivity is not about cramming more into our days but about doing *the right thing* in each moment.” <br><br>
- Letting your attentional space overflow negatively affects your memory. <br><br>
- Bailey: “Technology speeds up time by tempting us in each moment to fill our attention to the brim.” <br><br>
- Multitasking relies more on basal ganglia. When we focus on one thing, the brain engages the hippocampus more, which works to store the 
details of what we learn and allow us to recall them. <br>
    - <i>While multi-tasking may feel productive at that moment, it’s highly unproductive from a learning standpoint. 
    If you can’t remember what you learn, then you have to go learn it again. “Do it right, or do it again,” as my dad likes to say.</i><br><br>
- When we fill our attentional space up to the brim: <br>
    - It takes us longer to switch smoothly between tasks <br>
    - We’re less able to filter out irrelevant information in the environment <br>
    - The worse we get at suppressing the urge to switch to irrelevant things in the first place <br><br>
- On average, we work for only 40 seconds when working on a computer before either being interrupted or distracted. <br>
    - <b>Distraction is when we interrupt ourselves.</b> <br>
    - <i>How apt are you to do that? Observe your behaviour.</i><br>
    - Best work happens well beyond that 40-second mark. <br><br>
- <b>Attentional residue</b>: Coined by Sophie Leroy, prof of organizational behaviour at University of Washington <br>
    - When we switch tasks, it usually doesn’t happen perfectly. We have lingering thoughts about the previous task, which gunk up the attention 
    space that should be devoted to the task at hand. <br><br>
- Switching is easier and more effective (less attentional residue) when: <br>
- We finish a task – especially if there was time pressure or a deadline that forced us to “turn it in”, which prevents us from wondering if 
we could have done more or done it differently. <br>
- We disengage and reset between tasks – take a break, take a walk, meditate. <br><br>
- To put the concepts from this into practice: <br>
    - Set intentions more often. <br>
    - Modify the environment to be less distracting. <br>
    - Overcome mental resistance to doing tough tasks <br>
    - Eliminate distractions before they derail you <br>
    - Clear the distractions inside your head <br><br>
- Following these tenants will provide a lot of benefits. This one stood out to me: <br>
    - Bailey: “Develop deeper relationships and friendships as you <b>spend more attention, not just time, with people.”</b><br><br>
- Pay attention to: <br>
    - How much of your time do you spend intentionally?<br>
    - How long you can hold your focus in one sitting?<br>
    - How long your mind wanders before you catch it?<br>
