        Best Way To Learn Something Is To Teach It
    </b>
    <br>
    I've noticed that it's very easy for me to consume knowledge at an incredibly fast pace. The real problem is being able to apply all of these. 
    This causes a lot of people to forget what they learned because around 80% of the information obtained wasn't applicable in their daily lives 
    (even though it was useful and important).
    <br>
    I noticed that even though you don't apply the knowledge, it can be preserved by sharing it with others. 
    Repeating what was learned in a way that other people (who don't have the same past-knowledge) as you can understand is a 
    very easy way to safely store what you learn. As my father always said:
    <b>"Share it or lose it."</b>
    <br><br><br>
	<b style="font-family: Space Mono; font-size: 24px;">
        Just Start	
    </b>
    <br>
    Most people learn so much to prepare, but never actually apply it. They hoard knowledge to "raise their chances of winning." 
    They keep learning and get stuck in the loop, and end up never actually doing anything.
    <br>
    Truth is, if you never do anything, your "chance of winning" is zero.
    Don't get caught in the loop. <b>Learn, grow, do, share, improve, repeat.</b>
    <br><br><br>

        Make Real Friends and Drop Fake Friends	
    </b>
    <br>
    When my uncle first told me that I need to get rid of my fake friends, I ignored him thinking, "all my friends are real."
    As August came and I decided to stop being a people-pleaser and start living a meaningful life, 
    I noticed that my 200 friends quickly turned into 3 and my Instagram followers went from 950 to 100 in a week.
    I was shocked, hurt and insulted myself for not listening to my uncle's warning.
    <br>
    I kept giving value and doing my work through a long period of getting insulted by my "friends." After a month, I got 30 friends that I was happy with.
    <br>
    My uncle's warning won't be ignored again. I decided that I'll only call someone my friend if they bring value into my life. 
    That narrowed down my 30 friends to just 2.
    <br>
    I remained careful and only approved of those who were crucial to my growth and happiness. After another 4 months, 
    my list grew to 10 (which is still small, but good enough to keep me going).
    Now, I don't need anyone's support other than myself. If <b>I</b> am okay, then all is well. My long periods of loneliness didn't go to waste.
    <br><br><br>

        Don't Compare Yourself To Others. Be Your Own Competitor	
    </b>
    <br><br>
    <b><i>"Live your life for you."</i></b>
    <br>

    <br><br>
    We spend so much time worrying about what others think of us. We constantly question, 
    "what would he/she think?" That mindset works for giving gifts, <b>not life.</b>
    <br>
    Poor people get stressed thinking whether they'll eat another meal, whether they can find shelter for yet another cold night, 
    whether they can make it to tomorrow. Yet most of us are here getting depressed because the person you have a crush on didn't like your Instagram post, 
    or because your best friend replied late.
    <br>
    We should focus on things that are important and stop striving to please everybody.
    As I always say, <b><i>"You can't please everybody. Stop trying to."</i></b>
    <br><br>
    <b>FYI:</b> I used to be a massive people-pleasing machine. It's never too late to change.

        Don't Make Content To Get New Followers. Do It For The Ones Who Already Follow You

        Listen	
    </b>
    <br>
    Stop being arrogant. There's wisdom in everything. Shut up and listen.
    <br><br><br>
    <b style="font-family: Space Mono; font-size: 24px;">
        Don't Celebrate Too Early	
    </b>
    <br>
    If you spend too much time celebrating about the good, the bad may hit you when you are most vulnerable.
    <br>
    Celebrate modestly and prepare to tackle the next challenge.
