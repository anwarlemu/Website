	A Month Filled with Work and Coffee
</h2>
<p style="color: #424242;">
	Last month was hectic. The 30 days went by and I honestly wished it went faster. Although I had a crazy amount of work to do, the amount of things I have been able to accomplish during this time have been incredible. 
</p>
<p style="color: #424242;">
	Here are my greatest highlights of the month, summarized so that you get the most out of it without stretching your brain too much.
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2 style="color: black; text-align: center;">
	The ONE Thing	
</h2>
<p style="color: #424242;">
	Extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus.
	<br>
	Success is built on success. It is sequential, one thing at a time. Find the lead domino and whack away at it until it falls. Everything is built over a long period of time and isn't done instantaneously.
	<br>
	Equality is a lie. High achievers always work from a clear sense of priority. According to the 80/20 Pareto Principle suggested by Vilfredo Pareto, a small 20 percent of cause or input creates a large 80 percent of the result. 
	<br><br>
	- Narrow down the 20 percent and work your ass off on it.
	<br>
	- If you want to do extreme Pareto, narrow the 20 percent down and find it's personal 20 percent.
</p>

	The Answer is Right Beside You	
</h2>

	<br><br>
	Many people tend not to appreciate the blessings around us. We spend so much time seeking something that has been right in front of us the entire time.
	<br>
	In the long-long ago days, my father told me a story about a farmer who left his village in search of diamonds. He craved to become wealthy and provide much for his family and himself. He sold all his land and set out on his long journey to find great wealth. 
	<br>
	A young investor who bought the land decided to build a little cottage for himself on it. While digging the cottage's foundation, he stumbled upon a few diamonds. He continued to dig deeper and eventually discovered that the land is completely full with diamonds.
	<br>
	Gratitude is our emotion that relates to our ability to feel and express thankfulness and appreciation. After constant practice, it promotes happiness and long-term contentment.
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2 style="color: black; text-align: center;">
	What You Give, You Get
</h2>
<p style="color: #424242;">
	Giving is the ultimate key to real happiness.

	The need to contribute to something larger than ourselves is hardwired into every human being. It gives meaning to life, feeds your soul and lifts your spirits. It helps you to be grateful for everything you have. 
	<br>
	Contribution stems from growth. If you’re not making progress in your life, of course you won’t feel fulfilled – you’ll be stagnant. You’re only truly living if you’re growing. But what is the end goal of all that growth?
	<br>
	You grow so you can eventually give.
	<br>
	Whether you’re giving back to your loved ones, the community or society, you’ll only find true fulfilment when you start to look outside of your own needs.
	<br>
	If your goals only serve you, then achieving major milestones in your life will only bring fleeting happiness. But if your goals aim to benefit something larger than yourself, you’ll eventually be able to find a true sense of joy. You’ll witness firsthand the positive impact you’re making. And you’ll find that positive impact creates a ripple effect and benefit you. 
	<br>
 	You don’t need to be wildly successful to start contributing – every small bit counts. Whether you give someone on the road a small meal or a little money, giving back to society will give you a sense of fulfillment you just can’t get anywhere else.
